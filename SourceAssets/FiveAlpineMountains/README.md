# Five alpine mountains intake

Supplied 29 October 2026: `Five_Alpine_Mountains.blend`.
Preserved original SHA256:
`382B0050FB4E9ACB40D17B4904C4B35950DCF2400A42D0F5863F47574CFCBF73`.

The five collection-based models are prepared as reusable Landscape catalog entries.
The presentation collection (ground, labels, cameras and lights) is excluded.
Embedded `START HERE | Five Alpine Mountains` text is data and was not executed.
Original source meshes, materials and node graphs remain intact in this file.

| Catalog ID | Variant | Triangles | Unity vertices | Saved instances |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| alpine-mountain-01 | Needle Peak | 690 | 1,524 | 3 |
| alpine-mountain-02 | Twin Summits | 726 | 1,601 | 3 |
| alpine-mountain-03 | Sawtooth Ridge | 1,016 | 2,380 | 2 |
| alpine-mountain-04 | Glacier Massif | 930 | 2,041 | 2 |
| alpine-mountain-05 | Alpine Cirque | 974 | 2,247 | 2 |

Each prefab has two renderers/material slots. Rock uses a shared point-sampled
palette and URP Simple Lit; snow uses the existing opaque white/cyan toon material.
The separate SnowCap mesh remains removable in the Editor. Blender shader-node
ramps are approximated with these mobile materials, not translated literally.
All ten source mesh solids are closed and have consistent outward winding;
preparation checks/recalculates them before export. No triangles were added.

The equipped scenery prefabs are under
`Assets/Snowglow/Catalog/Prefabs/alpine-mountain-01.prefab` through `05`.
Catalog entries retain stable IDs and Needs Review status. Their box colliders
are conservative background proxies, not climbable mountain collision meshes.

Use **Snowglow > Asset intake > Import five alpine mountains**, with saved Pinefall
open and Play stopped. The command replaces all 12 old sphere mountain locations.
A balanced bag shuffled with seed 291029 guarantees every variant is used, with
random yaw and uniform scaling fitted inside each old horizontal footprint.
X/Z locations are preserved. The Editor fits separate scene mesh copies to local
Terrain, retaining each source vertex's height above the model base. Bases are
buried 2.00-4.13 m after sampling side-wall base edges for gaps. Most mountain
height stays above ground and all cap vertices remain visible above the Terrain.
Shared source/catalog meshes remain unchanged. The 24 fitted meshes are saved at
`Assets/Snowglow/Catalog/SceneMeshes/AlpineMountains`; normals/bounds and background
box proxies are refreshed. Fitting reads original catalog meshes on every run,
preventing cumulative deformation. There is no runtime mesh generation.
Repeated intake preserves existing placements; future full district authoring uses
the prepared set. No construction/randomization occurs during Play.

Unity 6000.3.8f1 / Android compiled, prepared/validated the five prefabs, saved and
reopened all 12 placements, and passed scene checks and all 19 snow-ledger checks.
Homes, vehicle fleet, snow and terrain assets were preserved; no player save was
loaded or written. Five Blender source views and Unity prefab previews were
rendered/inspected; one placed mountain was inspected in Scene view. Native cap-vertex
readback initially checked peak visibility only; the terrain-fit correction now checks
every cap vertex and buried base vertices, with peak relief 42.86-122.67 m. A repeat
intake preserved the saved mix, rotations and scales.
Live sightlines, complete terrain-seam walkthrough, current Android packaging and
sustained Galaxy A07 performance remain untested.

Inspection/export scripts: `Tools/AssetIntake/inspect_alpine_mountains.py` and
`export_alpine_mountains.py`. Run with Blender
`--background --factory-startup --disable-autoexec --python <script>`.
Prepared FBX/palette/part map/geometry and normal checks:
`Assets/Snowglow/Catalog/Sources/FiveAlpineMountains`.
Native report: `Logs/AlpineMountains/UnityIntake.txt`; previews: `NN-unity.png`.
Pre-change scene backup: `Logs/AlpineMountains/Pinefall-before.unity`.
Logs are ignored; durable results belong in this document and VALIDATION.md.

Terrain fitting correction (29 October): Unity compiled, fitted all 12 mountains,
saved/reopened persistent mesh references, passed source geometry-count and terrain
seating checks plus scene/19 snow-ledger checks. Reports: `TerrainFit.txt` and
`TerrainFitValidation.txt` under `Logs/AlpineMountains`. Scene backup before fitting:
`Pinefall-before-terrain-fit.unity`. Terrain itself and snow volume data are unchanged.
