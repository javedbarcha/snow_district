# Camera controls

Press **C** or tap **CAM** to cycle **Isometric -> Follow -> Orbit**.
Scenic is removed from gameplay. Its composition is reserved for a future static
main-menu background preview; that menu feature is not implemented here.
Existing serialized Scenic values migrate to Isometric.

| Mode | View |
| --- | --- |
| Isometric | Closer orthographic view at rest; smoothly widens with vehicle speed |
| Follow | Fixed rear offset; gentle pitch only: stopped 35 degrees, reverse 45, forward 15 |
| Orbit | Player-selected angle relative to the vehicle, following its heading through turns |

Isometric uses a 12 m orthographic half-height at rest and 19.2 m at 8 m/s,
with a 1.1 s exponential response. Reverse speed widens it too. Narrower aspect
ratios widen the vertical framing to retain vehicle/work-area coverage.
These are initial tuning values, editable on the saved CameraRig.

Follow keeps a fixed rear offset as travel direction changes. Only pitch changes:
35 degrees downward when stopped, 45 degrees in reverse (+10), and 15 degrees
moving forward (-20), with a gentle 2.5 s smoothing parameter. There is no
speed-dependent rise, approach or yaw arc. Tilt scales continuously with actual speed up to those limits (default full tilt
at 4 m/s, adjustable via followFullTiltSpeed), with a
+/-0.12 m/s drift band treated as stopped; gear selection at rest leaves it still.

The default offset is 13 m behind and approximately 10.7 m above the vehicle, framing it centrally
at the resting 35-degree tilt. Follow still tracks vehicle position/heading;
terrain/near-plane safety and obstacles can adjust the offset when required.
Pausing holds tilt. No steering remap or save schema change.

In Orbit:

| Action | PC | Phone |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rotate / tilt | Right-drag, or J/L and I/K | Drag an empty part of the view |
| Zoom | Wheel or +/- | Pinch with two world-view fingers |
| Reset | Home | VIEW RESET |

Orbit starts at 15 m / 25 degrees, with 7-42 m distance, 5-75 degree pitch and full
yaw. Your chosen yaw stays relative to the vehicle: turning the machine carries
the camera around with it, and another orbit gesture establishes the new retained
angle. Pitch and requested zoom stay as selected. There is no timed return to
the rear view. Pause holds the heading anchor; reset restores the default rear
angle, and switching machines/modes keeps the existing recentering behavior.
The horizon remains level rather than inheriting chassis roll. HUD-origin touches are excluded from camera gestures. Switching machinery
recentres the camera. Pause freezes speed zoom and direction changes. Camera
preferences remain session-only, with no player-save schema change.

The single authored CameraRig retains world/pile obstruction sweeps and vehicle
exclusion in Follow and Orbit. Obstructions can reduce their requested distance.
Isometric instead smooths its focus once at the fixed 41-degree pitch / 45-degree
yaw and does not use perspective collision pull-in. Its camera sits at least 60 m
back along the view axis (farther for large orthographic framing), protecting
near-plane clearance over town roofs without changing orthographic zoom. Terrain
safety retreats along that same axis, preserving screen composition. Near/far
speed zoom remains 12/19.2 m with the 1.1 s response. Roofs can naturally occlude
machinery beneath them; no roof-hiding system is added. Menu: **Snowglow > Install gameplay cameras and validate**.
Actual verification and remaining limitations belong in VALIDATION.md and
Logs/CameraModes/Validation.txt.

Orbit has only a left-anchored VIEW RESET button (at the 5% safe-area inset). On-screen zoom buttons are removed; pinch, wheel and keyboard +/- zoom remain.

The isometric roof correction passed native sampled tracking, canopy-obstruction,
zoom, aspect-ratio and depot near-plane checks with inspected renders. Evidence:
`Logs/IsometricRoof/Validation.txt`. Live driving and phone profiling remain
separate acceptance tasks.

Vehicle-relative Orbit tracking passed 2,660 native checks on Unity 6000.3.8f1 / Android, including 1,320 sampled turning frames and a changed player angle retained through later turns. Evidence: `Logs/OrbitHeading/Validation.txt`. This is sampled camera/input-independent validation, not a live phone-driving test.
